    <h1>Here is the truth.</h1>
    <p>With websites that look like this, It may seem like people are trying to make them <b>ugly.</b></p>
    <p>However, that couldn't be farther than the truth.</p>
    <p>Those websites are coded in HTML.</p>
    <p>When you code in HTML, the font normally looks like this.</p>
    <h5>The background is white.</h5>
    <h6>Super boring.</h6>
    <h6>Well i guess it's just because they dont bother to put in any effort.</h6>
    <h6>In my case, its just because i can't code in CSS.</h6>

    <p>Do you want a better look at how its made?</p>
    <p>I can add an image of the code!</p>
